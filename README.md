# LLM Performance Comparison Platform

## Introduction

Welcome to the **LLM Performance Comparison Platform**! This project is designed as an internship challenge where you will build a web-based platform allowing users to compare the performance of different Large Language Models (LLMs). This includes both custom queries and standardized evaluation datasets. This project offers hands-on experience with web development, API integration, and AI model evaluation techniques.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a platform where users can:

- Input custom queries and send them to multiple LLM APIs
- View and compare responses from different models
- Evaluate model performance using standardized datasets and metrics
- Visualize and analyze the results

## Core Features

### 1. Frontend Development
The frontend of the platform includes:
- A responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- An input field for users to send custom queries to multiple LLMs.
- A selection mechanism for choosing which LLMs to query.
- A display area showing responses from each selected LLM.
- A dashboard to view evaluation results and performance metrics.

### 2. Backend Development
The backend handles the API requests and evaluation logic:
- Built with a framework of choice (e.g., Node.js with Express or Python with Flask).
- Handles API routes for querying LLMs and processing results.
- Distributes queries to the selected LLM APIs and aggregates the results.
- Supports evaluation datasets and computes performance metrics.

### 3. LLM API Integration
The platform integrates with the following APIs:
- OpenAI GPT API
- Anthropic Claude API
- Meta's LLaMA API (or alternative)

**Features:**
- Secure management of API keys.
- Error handling and rate limiting as per API specifications.
  
### 4. Standardized Evaluation Integration
The platform supports at least two standardized evaluation datasets:
- **GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)**
- **SuperGLUE**
- **SQuAD**
- **TruthfulQA**
- **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**

The evaluation pipeline:
- Loads tasks from chosen datasets.
- Sends queries to each integrated LLM.
- Collects and stores responses.
- Computes performance metrics as per dataset specifications.

### 5. Results Display and Visualization
The platform includes:
- A comparison interface for side-by-side evaluation of LLM responses to custom queries.
- A performance dashboard displaying evaluation results.
- Visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) comparing LLM performance across various tasks and metrics.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (for a Node.js-based backend).
- API keys for OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and LLaMA (or alternative).

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lionggele/Chatbox_LLM_web.git
cd Chatbox_LLM_web
```

### Install Dependencies
To install the necessary frontend and backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### API Key Setup
Ensure that you have your API keys ready. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to securely store your API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
LLAMA_API_KEY=your_llama_api_key
```

### Running the Application
To start the frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

To start the backend:
```bash
npm run server
```

### Access the Application
Once the server is running, access the web platform via:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
