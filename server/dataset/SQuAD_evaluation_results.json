This building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the Church's General Assembly.

      "context": "Mortgage bankers, accountants, and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project. The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely, even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project. Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process. Cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation. Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid.",

      "llm_response": "The passage states that cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor **identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms**. \n\nHere's why this leads to cost overruns:\n\n* **Lack of Competition:** Once a contractor is awarded a government project, there's often no competitive bidding for subsequent changes. This means the contractor can potentially inflate the cost of these changes without facing pressure from other bidders.\n* **Opportunity for Abuse:**  The contractor has an incentive to propose changes that increase their profits, even if those changes are not strictly necessary or could be done more cost-effectively.\n* **Limited Oversight:**  Government oversight of project changes can be complex and may",

      "context": "Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, \"My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.\"",

      "correct_answer": "civil disobedience",
      "llm_response": "There are several reasons why people might resist officers of the law, even when their actions are considered \"civil disobedience\":\n\n**1. Principled Resistance:**\n\n* **Disagreement with the Law:** Some individuals believe the law they are breaking is unjust or immoral, and they actively resist as a form of protest. They see their actions as a moral imperative, even if it means facing legal consequences.\n* **Challenging Authority:** Civil disobedience can be a way to challenge the authority of the state and force a dialogue about the legitimacy of the law. This resistance is often motivated by a belief in the power of nonviolent action to bring about social change.\n\n**2. Emotional and Psychological Factors:**\n\n* **Fear and Anxiety:** The situation",
