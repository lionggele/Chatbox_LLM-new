    "correct_answer": "identified change orders or project changes that increased costs",
    "llm_response": "The passage states that cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor **identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms**. \n\nHere's why this leads to cost overruns:\n\n* **Lack of Competition:** Once a contractor is awarded a government project, there's often no competitive bidding for subsequent changes. This means the contractor can potentially inflate the cost of these changes without facing pressure from other bidders.\n* **Opportunity for Abuse:**  The contractor has an incentive to propose changes that increase their profits, even if those changes are not strictly necessary or could be done more cost-effectively.\n* **Limited Oversight:**  Government oversight of project changes can be complex and may"

    "correct_answer": "civil disobedience",
    "llm_response": "There are several reasons why people might resist officers of the law, even when their actions are considered \"civil disobedience\":\n\n**1. Principled Resistance:**\n\n* **Disagreement with the Law:** Some individuals believe the law they are breaking is unjust or immoral, and they actively resist as a form of protest. They see their actions as a moral imperative, even if it means facing legal consequences.\n* **Challenging Authority:** Civil disobedience can be a way to challenge the authority of the state and force a dialogue about the legitimacy of the law. This resistance is often motivated by a belief in the power of nonviolent action to bring about social change.\n\n**2. Emotional and Psychological Factors:**\n\n* **Fear and Anxiety:** The situation"

Here's how normal forces relate to the stress tensor:\n\n**Normal Forces and the Stress Tensor:**\n\n* **Normal forces** are forces that act perpendicular to a surface.  Think of a book sitting on a table \u2013 the table exerts an upward normal force on the book.\n* **Stress tensor** is a mathematical representation of the forces acting on a material. It has components that represent both normal forces (acting perpendicular to a surface) and shear forces (acting parallel to a surface).\n* **Diagonal elements** of the stress tensor represent the **normal stresses**. These are directly related to the normal forces"
