    "llm_response": "The text you provided already gives the answer! \n\nHere's a breakdown of what can be used to model tension forces:\n\n* **Ideal Strings:** These are the primary tool. They are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. This allows them to transmit force without any loss or change.\n* **Ideal Pulleys:** These are used to change the direction of the tension force. They are assumed to be frictionless and massless, so they don't affect the force transmission.\n\nBy combining these ideal elements, you can create models of various systems involving tension forces, like:\n\n* **Simple Atwood Machines:** Two masses connected by a string over a pulley.\n* **More Complex Pulleys"

    "question": "What causes Pauli repulsion?",
    "correct_answer": "fermionic nature of electrons",
    "llm_response": "You're absolutely right! The Pauli exclusion principle is the fundamental reason behind Pauli repulsion. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n**The Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n\n* **Electrons are fermions:** This means they are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In simpler terms, no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers (energy level, angular momentum, spin, etc.).\n* **Electron clouds:**  Atoms consist of a nucleus surrounded by a cloud of electrons. These electrons occupy specific energy levels and orbitals within the atom.\n\n**Pauli Repulsion in Action:**\n\n1. **Overlap:** When two atoms get very close together, their"

    "llm_response": "The passage clearly states that **the availability of materials in the area generally dictates the construction materials used**. \n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is the case:\n\n* **Accessibility:**  Materials that are readily available locally are easier and cheaper to transport, making them a more practical choice.\n* **Cost:**  Importing materials from far away increases costs due to transportation and potentially higher import tariffs.\n* **Tradition:**  Local building practices often develop around readily available materials, creating a tradition of using specific materials.\n\nWhile other factors like regulations, cost of labor, and design preferences also play a role, the passage emphasizes the significant influence of material availability on construction choices. \n"
