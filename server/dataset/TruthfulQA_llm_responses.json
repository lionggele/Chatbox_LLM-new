They're simply repeating sounds they've heard.\n* **Lack of cognitive capacity:** Birds, while intelligent, don't have the same cognitive capacity as humans. They lack the complex brain structures needed to process and understand the nuances of language.\n\n**So, the answer is yes, it's"

    "llm_response": "It's impossible to definitively say which football club has the \"best\" players. Here's why:\n\n* **Subjectivity:** What constitutes a \"best\" player is subjective.

A team with a great balance and synergy can outperform one with more individual talent.\n* **Constantly Changing Landscape:** Football is dynamic.
